    <p>A chocolate factory produces several types of chocolate, some
      of which have nut centres.  The chocolates are mixed together
      and are randomly packed into cartons of ten.</p>

    <uploadInteraction responseIdentifier="RESPONSE">
      <prompt>Build a spreadsheet to simulate 50 cartons of chocolates
        when each carton contains 10 chocolates, and when one-seventh
        of the chocolates have nut centres.  Your spreadsheet should
        include 50 rows representing the 50 cartons, each row
        containing 10 columns to represent the chocolates.</prompt>
